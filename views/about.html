            <hr />
            <h2>1. Help our members excel outside of the classroom.</h2>
            <p>
                Taken from first-hand experience with hackathons, internships, and interviews
                with employees at big-name companies (like Google and Yahoo!), we can say
                with certainty that if you only ever work on your class assignments, you will not
                be prepared to compete for positions at top-tier tech companies. And you just won't b
                e able to make much cool stuff in general. So much of a programmer's education
                is done on his/her own time. Our goal is to make that experience easier, through
                a series of workshops that will help you develop skills in web development, game
                development, robotics, modern software engineering practices, and more.
            <h2>2. Build up a community of programmers at Lehigh.</h2>
            <p>
                Presently, there just isn't much of a programming community at Lehigh. A lot of
                people are just doing their own thing. However, we all have so much knowledge to
                share with each other, and the best projects often come out of collaborations. By
                meeting together and learning/teaching new skills together, we can get to know one
                another better and create awesome stuff.

            <h2>Github</h2>
            <p>
                These days, having a Github account is practically a necessity in
                the software engineering field. It's a great way to find awesome
                tools and frameworks, make contributions to open source software, and
                show employers that you're passionate about what you do. We use our
                Github account as a way to store all of our code that we use at
                our workshops.

            <h2>Facebook</h2>
            <p>
                Facebook is a wonderful communication tool. We use our Facebook page
                as a way to advertise upcoming events, as well as to promote discussion
                on various technical issues.

            <h2>Flickr</h2>
            <p>
                With every event comes photos, and the best place to store photos
                is Flickr. The photo experience on Facebook just isn't as nice,
                and you have to have a Facebook account to view them. With Flickr,
                you avoid those issues, and you get 1TB of space to boot.
