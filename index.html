                        <span class="first-sentence">Class is great, but it can't teach you everything.</span> Courses at Lehigh focus
                        on core programming concepts and theory, and unfortunately don't ever go
                        much into practical applications. We're hoping to fill that gap by
                        running a series of workshops where you'll learn skills like web development, 
                        game development, modern software engineering best practices and styles, and more that they don't
			teach you in the classroom!

                    <p>
                        <span class="first-sentence">Our events and hackathons bring together the programming community.</span> 
			Events are open to everyone, no matter what level of programming experience. 
			The events are a great way to meet and learn from other programmers in the Lehigh community as well as a place where you can show off what you've learned and earn 
                        great prizes from sponsors such as Google, IBM, Lutron, and more!
                    </p>

                        <span class="first-sentence">LU Apps application development competition</span> 
                        is a competition held in the fall where students develop and showcase an application. 
                        The application can be anything from a game to schedule planner, and there are prizes given out by 
                        many big name corporate sponsors!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="first-sentence">MobiLehigh mobile game development competition</span> 
                        is a competition held in the spring where students develop and showcase a mobile game. 
                        Everyone is encouraged to participate, not just programmers - games also need design, art, and story! 
                        Leading up to the event are several workshops on game development as well as several checkpoints to 
                        make the process as easy as possible. On the day of the showcase, students from the local middle school come 
                        to play the games and vote on their favorite, as well as judges from several companies.

                        is a hackathon which was started just last year, but saw an amazing turnout and many great creations! 
                        You'll have 36 hours to work with a team to create an application, website, program, or whatever you'd 
                        like to create using technology provided by the many corporate sponsors! Last year IBM made available their 
                        Watson computing technology. The event includes free food and drinks, many prizes, tons of learning and 
                        networking opportunities, and a great experience!

                    <p>
                        Programming Club also represents Lehigh's chapter of the Association for Computing
                        Machinery (ACM). As such, we participate in ACM events like the Intercollege
                        Programming Competition (ICPC), where teams race to code the solutions to a series
                        of logic puzzles.
